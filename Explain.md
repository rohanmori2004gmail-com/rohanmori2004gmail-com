Python files Explains
app.py
1. Imports and Application Setup
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS
from chat import get_response
Flask: Flask is a micro web framework for Python used to build web applications.
render_template: This function is used to render HTML templates. In this code, it is used to render the base.html template.
request: This object represents the incoming request sent by the client.
jsonify: Converts Python dictionaries into JSON format, making it easier to send JSON responses from the server.
Flask-CORS (CORS): This extension allows Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the Flask application, which is essential when dealing with client-side applications that may be hosted on different domains.
chat.get_response: This imports the get_response function from the chat module. This function is likely used to generate a response based on the input text provided by the client.
2. Flask Application Initialization
app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)
Flask Application Creation (Flask(__name__)): This line creates a Flask application instance. __name__ is a special Python variable that represents the name of the current module. It's typically used to determine the root path of the application.
CORS(app): This line enables CORS support for the Flask application. CORS allows web servers to specify who can access its resources on a different origin (domain) than the one that served the request.
3. Route Definitions
Route /
@app.route("/")
def index_get():
   return render_template("base.html")
@app.route("/"): This decorator binds the function index_get to the root URL / of the Flask application.
index_get(): This function is executed when a GET request is sent to the root URL (/). It returns the rendered template base.html. This template is typically located in a templates directory in the same directory as the main Flask script.
Route /predict
@app.route("/predict", methods=["POST"])
def predict():
    text = request.get_json().get("message")
    #TODO: check if text is valid
    response = get_response(text)
    message = {"answer": response}
    return jsonify(message)
   @app.route("/predict", methods=["POST"]): This decorator binds the function predict to the URL /predict with the HTTP method POST. This means this route expects POST requests to be sent to /predict.
predict(): This function is executed when a POST request is sent to /predict.
request.get_json().get("message"): request.get_json() parses the JSON data sent in the request body, and .get("message") retrieves the value associated with the key "message" from the JSON data. This assumes that the client sends JSON data with a key "message" containing the text for which a response is requested.
get_response(text): This function is called with the text obtained from the request. It presumably processes this text and generates a response.
message = {"answer": response}: Creates a Python dictionary message with the key "answer" containing the response obtained from get_response.
return jsonify(message): Converts the message dictionary into JSON format and returns it as the HTTP response to the client.
4. Main Application Entry Point
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
if __name__ == "__main__":: This conditional statement checks if the script is being run directly (not imported as a module).
app.run(debug=True): Starts the Flask development server. debug=True enables debug mode, which provides useful debugging information if there's an error in your application. It also automatically reloads the application when code changes are detected.
Summary
Purpose: This Flask application serves a web interface (base.html) at the root URL and provides an API endpoint (/predict) that accepts POST requests containing JSON data with a "message" key. It then uses the get_response function to generate a response based on the input text and returns it as JSON.
Functionality: It integrates a front-end (HTML template) with a back-end (API endpoint) for processing text-based queries and generating responses, suitable for integration with a chatbot or similar application.
This setup enables communication between a client-side application (like a JavaScript frontend) and the server-side Flask application, allowing for dynamic content generation based on user input.

chat.py
This Python script sets up a simple chatbot using a neural network model implemented with PyTorch. Let's go through the code and explain its functionality in detail:

Imports and Setup
import random
import json
import torch

from model import NeuralNet
from nltk_utils import bag_of_words, tokenize
random: Python module for generating random numbers and making random selections.
json: Module for working with JSON data.
torch: PyTorch deep learning framework.
NeuralNet: Custom neural network model imported from model.py.
bag_of_words: Function from nltk_utils module to convert text into a bag of words representation.
tokenize: Function from nltk_utils module to tokenize input text.
Device Selection and Model Loading
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

with open('chatbot-deployment-main/data/intents.json', 'r') as json_data:
    intents = json.load(json_data)

FILE = "data.pth"
data = torch.load(FILE)

input_size = data["input_size"]
hidden_size = data["hidden_size"]
output_size = data["output_size"]
all_words = data['all_words']
tags = data['tags']
model_state = data["model_state"]

model = NeuralNet(input_size, hidden_size, output_size).to(device)
model.load_state_dict(model_state)
model.eval()

bot_name = "CEC_BOT"
device: Selects the device (GPU or CPU) for running the PyTorch model based on availability.
Loading Data and Model:
intents.json: Contains predefined intents for the chatbot, including tags and responses.
data.pth: PyTorch serialized file containing trained model data (input_size, hidden_size, output_size, all_words, tags, and model_state).
model_state: State dictionary of the trained neural network model.
NeuralNet: Initializes an instance of the NeuralNet model with the loaded parameters and moves it to the selected device (GPU or CPU).
Function get_response
def get_response(msg):
    sentence = tokenize(msg)
    X = bag_of_words(sentence, all_words)
    X = X.reshape(1, X.shape[0])
    X = torch.from_numpy(X).to(device)

    output = model(X)
    _, predicted = torch.max(output, dim=1)

    tag = tags[predicted.item()]

    probs = torch.softmax(output, dim=1)
    prob = probs[0][predicted.item()]
    if prob.item() > 0.75:
        for intent in intents['intents']:
            if tag == intent["tag"]:
                return random.choice(intent['responses'])
    
    return "I do not understand..."
get_response(msg): Function that takes a message (msg) as input and returns a response based on the trained model's predictions.
Tokenization and Bag of Words:
tokenize(msg): Tokenizes the input message.
bag_of_words(sentence, all_words): Converts the tokenized sentence into a bag of words representation using the all_words vocabulary.
Model Inference:
X: Converts the bag of words representation (X) into a PyTorch tensor and moves it to the selected device.
output: Runs the input through the neural network model to get the output.
torch.max(output, dim=1): Finds the index of the maximum value in the output tensor, indicating the predicted class/tag.
tag: Retrieves the tag corresponding to the predicted index.
Probability Threshold:
probs: Computes the softmax probabilities of the output.
prob: Retrieves the probability of the predicted tag.
Checks if the probability (prob) is greater than 0.75. If so, randomly selects a response from the intents associated with the predicted tag.
Fallback Response:
If the probability is not high enough or no suitable intent is found, returns a default response indicating lack of understanding.
